# ts-lib

> Scaffold TypeScript libraries

This is a custom built generator to satisfy my own personal needs and to also
have a working example of my command line framework [Reginn](https://github.com/TylorS/reginn).

More features are definitely planned, by slimming down on dependencies and achieving
the features internally, in TypeScript!

This library is super straightforward to use as all you have to do is install and
answer 3 simple questions, and thats it!

## Here is how to use it
```sh
npm install -g ts-library

mkdir myCoolLibrary

cd myCoolLibrary

npm init # follow the prompts

tslib init # answer a few questions and you're good to go!
```
